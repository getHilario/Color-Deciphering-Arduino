# Color-Deciphering-Arduino
Project for a color sensing Arduino microcontroller that separates green and blue M&amp;M's depending on color.
The components consist of a color sensor for sensing the temperature and a stepper motor to conduct proper sorting. 
Colors within the specified range of values are sorted accordingly.
